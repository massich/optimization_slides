* [ ] Some hints about minimization (I'm sure I'm not the best one to present this, but still)
* [ ] Formulating image segmentation as a minimization problem.
  * [ ] Overview ( defining the sub-problems to tackle )
  * [ ] studying the sub-problems
  * [ ] Image segmentation recapitulation
* [ ] Once you know what's a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Open talk about other computer vision problems, that can be solved with the proposed framework.
